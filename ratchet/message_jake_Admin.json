My expertise lies in using technology to solve complex business challenges.  In my previous roles as a Team Lead and Software\/DevOps Engineer, I have utilized a diverse set of technologies (PHP, Java, Python, ReactJS, SQL, NoSQL, Docker, Jenkins, Elastic Stack, etc.) to deliver impactful solutions across finance, housing, healthcare, eCommerce, and regulatory sectors. Recent projects that I led include: \u2022\tFIAPS (Financial Institutions Application Processing System) for the Central Bank of Nigeria that automated over 46 business processes, including legal tasks such as Writ of Summons and Garnishee Orders. \u2022\tNigeria National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) Monitoring & Evaluation System: This project integrated diverse data sources, including personal identity information (PII), financial, geographical, and social media data, to create dashboards and intelligence reports. These tools enhanced the traceability of enrollment activities and provided sentiment analysis on social media feeds. It was an inter-organizational project that involved coordination with over 30 government ministries and agencies, private contractors, and the integration of various third-party applications via APIs. As a disciplined, research-oriented, and self-motivated team player, in the past 12 years, I co-founded two software firms: MAYBEACH TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED and HYELLA LIMITED that currently employ over 20 individuals. I also provided technical leadership during my MSc Group Project to my team of 5 individuals, a process that inspired me to publish a Python package that improved our ease of technical implementation. I continue to showcase these qualities in my current role as the IT Support Coordinator of the University of Essex Students\u2019 Union, a diverse and inclusive workplace where I efficiently managed varying expectations of resolving day-to-day IT challenges and coordinating long-term projects like Windows 11 Migration and safe disposal of electronic waste inline with internal & GDPR policies. I have always sought out capacity development opportunities in my current role, where I have acquired skills in Anti-racism\/Unconscious Bias and how to Tackle Misogyny, Harassment, and Sexual Violence. Recently, I have transferred my knowledge and experience to diverse Artificial Intelligence projects. I am well-equipped to develop an Explainable AI (XAI) solution tailored for legal support and capable of handling diverse data types such as text, images, and audio. My approach to explainable AI development begins with implementing simple, interpretable models for immediate insights, then advancing to more complex techniques using tools like Eli5 and Captum to maintain transparency. For example, in a sentiment analysis project for automotive reviews on eCommerce platforms, I began with basic classifiers and used word clouds for visual explanations before fine-tuning a BERT model to enhance accuracy and employing SHAP to interpret predictions and highlight influential features. Another noteworthy project was my vision-based fall detection system, where I initially developed simple algorithms to analyze joint key points through \"what-if\" scenarios. As I progressed, I integrated advanced techniques like probabilistic reasoning and fuzzy logic to enhance accuracy and handle data uncertainties. This layered approach exemplifies my focus on balancing simplicity with complexity and ensuring explainability; key components when designing AI systems for sensitive fields like legal tech. I am eager to contribute my skills and experience to your team. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can add value as your next AI Engineer (KTP Associate). Sincerely, Patrick O.
